# CISC 192: Arrays/Vectors Lab #
Learning Objectives
Declaring an array
Declaring a vector
Initializing an array
Initializing a vector
Accessing an element in an array
Accessing an element in a vector
Updating an element in an array
Description
You are running a digital library. The library has several books for users to check out. Your library has 4 tasks.

Listing all the books in the catalog (initial values provided for you in a string array)
Listing all the books available for checkout 
Checking out a book
Returning a book

We won’t really be checking in and out books, but we will be tracking the availability. For this lab you are provided with a template main.cpp file with some code. This contains the book names and scaffolding for your user interaction loop. You are also provided a reference program to code against. Your code should function identically to the reference program. If you believe there is a problem with the reference code or lab write up, please email me. I distribute extra credit points to the first report of an issue.
Submission
Start a new project called ArraysLab. All the code for the lab should be contained in main.cpp. Once you are finish, zip the entire project directory. Rename the zip file to <first_name_last_name>ArraysLab.zip and submit via Blackboard.
Hints
You must hit all the learning objectives to get full credit
Play with the example program, make sure to cover all cases
The number 11, the number of books, should not show up in the code.
Rubric
0 points for the assignment if the code doesn’t compile
0 points for the assignment for code does not use at least one vector and one array
2 points for listing all the books using a vector
3 points for listing all the available books (books that aren’t checked out)
4 points for checking out a book using a vector and an array
4 points for returning a book using a vector and an array
2 points for handling invalid input
4 points from additional test cases and other criteria, including using the correct language constructs. E.g., switch/case vs. if/else and while vs. for.
Points will be removed if the size of the array or vector is used directly, e.g. 11 shows up in the code.
